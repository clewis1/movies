# movies-web

This is the web layer for the movies application.
To start the application, open the pom.xml file in Intellij (or any suitable IDE).
Next run "MovieWebApplication" and ensure the api layer is also running (See movies-api README.md for more details).

When both layers are up and running, head to http://localhost:8080/ to begin using the application.
Note: port number set at default. Please check your port number at application start up.
